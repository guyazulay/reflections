How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
staging area is in the "middle" - between the working directory and the repository. It give us the option
to track a file and make it as a potential for commit changes.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
I can compare the staging area to the curent working directory and/or to the last commit.
If the diff between the staging area and the last commit is only one logical change , i cancontinue with the next commit.
