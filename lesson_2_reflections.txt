What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

this hidden folder consist the whole history and saves all the changes happened since git was initialized.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
staging area is in the "middle" - between the working directory and the repository. It give us the option
to track a file and make it as a potential for commit changes.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
I can compare the staging area to the curent working directory and/or to the last commit.
If the diff between the staging area and the last commit is only one logical change , i cancontinue with the next commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
branch will be very hekpfull when we will want to make a big change/ insert new feature that we don't really know how will it affect our app.
Parallel, we still want to fix and develop our code so we continue to do so in the main branch.
Another situation of creating a side branch is when we would like to present some new feature ( or a customed feature) to some client.
so we will do it seperately and then, further, we will merge it to the main code.
