When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when i would like to share my repository with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because I don't want that any change will be seen by other people. e.g , when I'm working on a new feature but i still hasn't tested it.
